# Code Reviews

In this section, we’ll talk about the challenges we might run into and the steps we can take to make code reviews actually work in our team. Code reviews aren’t just for finding bugs — when we do them properly, they help us learn from each other, share knowledge, and keep the quality of our code high. Sometimes, in a fast-paced team, we might be tempted to skip them, but this can lead to misunderstandings or bugs slipping into production.

By looking at what other developers have done — both the good and the bad — we can figure out what actually works. Code reviews are most useful when they’re focused on team understanding, not just pointing out mistakes. It’s about helping each other improve, not tearing things apart. We need to be able to give helpful feedback, but also take it on board ourselves. The best code reviews look at logic, clarity, and functionality, not just the surface stuff. Everyone should feel welcome to take part, no matter their role or experience — you never know who might spot something valuable. Done right, reviews can become a habit that genuinely helps the team and the codebase.
