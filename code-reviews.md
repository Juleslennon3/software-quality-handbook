# Code Reviews

When we talk about code reviewing, we are not only discussing the team looking over code and searching for mistakes, we are trying to deepen everyone's knowledge of the code base. By doing this, we will increase the quality of the code. It can seem like a skippable step, especially in our fast-paced team, but doing this can lead to big issues and misunderstandings quite quickly. 

Reviews work best in a team that is happy to work together and understands each other. You must give a detailed explanation of what went wrong and help teach them why it was wrong. You must also be able to receive feedback and not take it personally. The most effective reviews are based on logic, clarity, and functionality, not just the high-level issue. We are a team, so everyone should be involved in this process, as you never know how someone might be able to help or add original insight.

We can look at other developers' good and bad experiences and try to incorporate them into our team, so we don't have to make those mistakes ourselves.

## Good Practices for Code Reviews

- **Keep changes small and focused**  
  Smaller reviews are easier to understand, quicker to approve, and less likely to miss important issues.

- **Give feedback kindly and clearly**  
  Reviews should feel like collaboration, not criticism. Be specific and explain the “why” behind suggestions. If the recipient isn’t sure why the feedback was given, they may feel attacked.

- **Review with purpose, not perfection**  
  Focus on logic, clarity, and bugs — don’t block a change just for small style issues.

- **Make reviews timely**  
  Try to respond to review requests within an agreed time frame. It’s better to give feedback while the work is still fresh in everyone’s mind.

- **Encourage everyone to participate**  
  Junior developers, seniors, and even other teams can all provide valuable feedback. Overlooking someone not only limits potential insight but can also hurt team morale.

- **Treat reviews as learning opportunities**  
  Use them to ask questions, explain decisions, and help others understand the codebase. Knowledge sharing is essential for teams to work in tandem and maintain consistent quality.

- **Use tools to reduce friction**  
  Automated checks (like static analysis or style checkers) help free up time for meaningful feedback.

## Bad Practices to Avoid

- **Leaving vague comments**  
  Saying “fix this” without any explanation doesn’t help and can confuse the author. Don’t leave anything up to interpretation — be clear and honest about why you flagged something.

- **Being overly critical or personal**  
  Harsh or sarcastic feedback creates tension and damages trust within the team.

- **Reviewing huge chunks of code at once**  
  Large reviews are overwhelming and increase the chance of missing important issues. Reviewing smaller pieces consistently is more manageable for everyone.

- **Skipping reviews under pressure**  
  Pushing code through without review to save time often leads to bigger problems later.

- **Nitpicking low-impact issues**  
  Avoid focusing too much on formatting or personal style preferences unless it affects functionality. Everyone on the team works differently, and reviews should accommodate that.

- **Dragging out the process**  
  Delaying approvals or going silent without updates slows the team down. We need to stay transparent with each other.

- **Only letting senior devs review**  
  Everyone brings a unique perspective — code review should be a shared team responsibility, not a top-down process.
